The first six exercises are from Beck, _Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization_. 

1. (Convexity of set operations) Exercise 6.1
2. (Convex hull) Exercise 6.4
3. (Normal cone) Exercise 6.10
4. (Convex functions) Exercise 7.1 (i--ii)
5. (Affine functions) Exercise 7.3
6. (Strict convexity) Exercise 7.7 
1. (Entropy) Show that $f(x) = -\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\log x_i$ is concave over the probability simplex $\bar\Delta_n=\{ x\in \R^n_+\mid \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \}$.
2. (Log-Sum-Exp) Show that $f(x) = \log\left(\sum_{i=1}^m e^{a_i^T x}\right)$ is convex in $\R^n$, where $a_1,\ldots,a_m\in\R^n$.
