## Q1. Quadratic functions
- Beck, Exercise 2.19

## Q2. Homogeneity of the directional derivative

**(a)** Prove that the directional derivative (when it exists) of a function $f:\Re^n\to\Re$ is positively homogeneous of degree one, that is, show that for all $\alpha\ge0$,
$$
f'(x;\alpha d) = \alpha f'(x;d).
$$
Use this fact to argue that the directions $d$ in which the directional derivative is evaluated can always be normalized, so that $\|d\|_2=1$.

**(b)** Which unit-norm direction minimizes the directional derivative, i.e., which direction provides the largest instantaneous decrease in $f$ at the point $x$?

## Q3. Nonlinear least squares (Beck, Exercise 4.6)

**(a)** Derive the gradient $\nabla f(x)$. (Note that this is a slightly different objective than used in the formulation discribed in lecture. Yes, you could use AD to compute this, but here we're asking you to derive it analytically.)

**(b)** Part (ii) of this problem.
